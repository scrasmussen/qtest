======================
Current Fortran Chain:
======================
main -> qmpi -> ctool -> pmpi_x -> pmpi -> pmpi_x -> ctool -> qmpi -> main

example/ is the directory that has the example files that use print statements to show this path.

========
qwrap.py
========
qwrap.py will read in the aterms and c-tool call and create the two wrappers to follow the chain. It currently also creates the ctools file.

=====
TO DO
=====
-add more mpi calls to example. send, receive, and two others that are on the wiki
-add header file for the second wrappers c functions. Intel's compiler doesn't currently complain but other will probably be more picky
-which lead to: When example is complete test on all three openmpi compilers
-create a c function to return the size of handles. Status type is an important one to inspect
-read mpi manual on opque data types
