======================
Current Fortran Chain:
======================
main -> qmpi -> ctool -> pmpi_x -> pmpi -> pmpi_x -> ctool -> qmpi -> main

example/ is the directory that has the example files that use print statements to show this path.

========
qwrap.py
========
qwrap.py will read in the aterms and c-tool call and create the two wrappers to follow the chain. It currently also creates the ctools file.

=====
TO DO
=====
-create c file to calculate size of handles. In fortran just create space for them and if you have space you can allocate space. We'll have prototypes for the c and then the Fortran can just call those. Give presentation 
-add more mpi calls to example. send, receive, and comm_size, comm_rank
-write sizeof in c to create a file with all the types definitions
   - declare types and pass them to c
   - use mpi_comm_world. check to see how things are copied, ie value reference
   - use ==
-add header file for the second wrappers c functions. Intel's compiler doesn't currently complain but other will probably be more picky
-which lead to: When example is complete test on all three openmpi compilers
-create a c function to return the size of handles. Status type is an important one to inspect
-read mpi manual on opque data types
-Final product must have testing and documentation for everything
